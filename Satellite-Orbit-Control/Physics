Physics

1. Simplified Orbit
Motion of moon around earth in Cartesian coordinate (x-y)
The position of earth is the origin of the coordinate
The trajectory of moon is:
x=D*cos(2*pi*t/T)
y=D*sin(2*pi*t/T)
where D is the distance between moon and earth (assuming it is a circle orbit, D is constant), D=4*10^8 meter
where t is the time experienced
where T is the orbit period of moon travelling around earth, in this case, using T=27 days

2. Newton's Second Law
F=m*a=m*x''
where F is the force exerted on the object, N
where m is the mass of the object, kg
where a is the acceleration of the object, m/s^2
where x'' is the second derivative of the distance that object travelled, which is equal to the acceleration of the object

3. Forward Euler Method
x(delta_t)=x(0)+(delta_t-0)*v(delta_t-0)
v(delta_t)=v(0)+(delta_t-0)*a(delta_t-0)
x(2*delta_t)=x(delta_t)+(2*delta_t-delta_t)*v(2*delta_t-delta_t)
v(2*delta_t)=v(delta_t)+(2*delta_t-delta_t)*a(2*delta_t-delta_t)
where delta_t is a small time step

4. Newton's Law of Gravitation
Fg=GMm/R^2
where Fg is the force of gravity, N
where G is a constant, 6.67*10^-11 Nm^2/kg^2
where M and m is the mass of earth and moon, kg.  m=7.3*10^22 kg
where R is the distance between earth and moon, m

5. Shell Theorem
Shell sphere radius=R, mass=M, volumn=V, area=A, force=F
Core sphere radius=R/2, thus area=(1/2)^2*A, volumn=(1/2)^3*V, mass=(1/2)^3*M
Shell F=GMm/R^2
Core F=G(M/8)m/(R/4)=F/2
